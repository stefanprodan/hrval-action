This GitHub action validates a Flux
[Helm Release](https://docs.fluxcd.io/projects/helm-operator/en/latest/references/helmrelease-custom-resource.html)
Kubernetes custom resources with [kubeval](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval).

Steps:
* installs kubectl, yq, kubeval, helm v2 and v3
* extracts the chart source with yq
* downloads the chart from the Helm or Git repository
* extracts the Helm Release values with yq
* runs helm template for the extracted values
* validates the YAMLs using kubeval strict mode

## Usage

Validate Helm release custom resources:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
      - name: Validate Helm Release from Helm Repo
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/flagger.yaml
          helmVersion: v2
          kubernetesVersion: 1.17.0
      - name: Validate Helm Release from Git Repo
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/podinfo.yaml
          helmVersion: v3
          kubernetesVersion: master
          ignoreValues: true
```

## Usage with private charts repositories

### Private GitHub/GitLab repository
To allow the action to be able to clone charts from private GitHub repositories,
you must [create a GitHub private access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
and [add it as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) to the target repository. NOTE: secret names *cannot* start with `GITHUB_` as these are reserved.

You can then pass the secret (in this case, `GH_TOKEN`) into the action like so:
```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
```

Gitlab CI Token is also possible using `GITLAB_CI_TOKEN`.

### AWS S3

If you set `awsS3Repo: true`,  make sure you set the appropriate environment variables for helm s3 plugin to work.  Example:
```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
          awsS3Repo: true
          awsS3RepoName: example-s3-helm-repo
          awsS3Plugin: https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3.git
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: "us-east-1"

```

### HTTP(S) Helm chart repository

To allow fetching Helm charts from private Helm chart repositories you need to
pass a list of Helm repositories in `HTTP_PRIVATE_CHART_REPOS` environment variable as JSON.

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/helm-chart-repository/master/",
      "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
      "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/another-helm-chart-repository/master/",
      "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
      "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
    }
  ]
}
```

It should be passed [as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets)
to keep credentials secure.

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
        env:
          HTTP_PRIVATE_CHART_REPOS: ${{ secrets.HTTP_PRIVATE_CHART_REPOS }}
```


## Usage with pull requests containing changes of Helm chart source located in base repository branch

If a base repository branch of pull request is referenced in helm release,
you need to pass `HRVAL_BASE_BRANCH` and `HRVAL_HEAD_BRANCH` environment variables
to an action to make sure it will check out amended version of the chart
from a head repository branch.


```yaml
name: CI

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
        env:
          HRVAL_BASE_BRANCH: ${{ github.base_ref }}
          HRVAL_HEAD_BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

## Usage with Helm source caching enabled

Sometimes single Helm release might be referenced multiple times in a single Flux repository,
for example if staging branch of Helm chart repository is used as a release ref across all staging releases.
A property named `helmSourcesCacheEnabled` enables caching for such releases,
so a single Helm repository chart version or Git repository ref
will be retrieved only once, and cached version will be used for validation of another releases which reuse same sources.


```yaml
name: CI

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
          helmSourcesCacheEnabled: true
```

## Injecting "valuesFrom"

Validation supports [HelmReleases using "valuesFrom"](https://docs.fluxcd.io/projects/helm-operator/en/stable/helmrelease-guide/values/#values-from-sources)
with "secretKeyRef" or "configMapKeyRef".
To use this feature, you need to keep configMaps and secrets used by "valuesFrom" in the repository.
To enable it - pass a property named `valuesFromDir` pointing to the directory with configMaps and secrets.

```yaml
name: CI

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  hrval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
        uses: stefanprodan/hrval-action@master
        with:
          helmRelease: test/
          valuesFromDir: test/valuesfrom/
```


## CI alternatives

The validation scripts can be used in any CI system.

CircleCI example:

```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  hrval:
    docker:
      - image: stefanprodan/hrval:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Validate Helm Releases in test dir
          command: |
            IGNORE_VALUES=false
            KUBE_VER=master
            HELM_VER=v2

            hrval test/ $IGNORE_VALUES $KUBE_VER $HELM_VER
```
